# mplayerosx-builds

mplayerosx-builds is a collection of scripts that I use to compile my mplayer.git on the Mac.

The project here on github is a rewrite of the scripts that make use of [mxcl/homebrew](http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew). The original project is on [Google code](http://code.google.com/p/mplayerosx-builds/). It is still work in progress!
